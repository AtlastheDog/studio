## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#1A237E) for a sense of professionalism, trust, and stability, aligning with the goal of presenting a polished image to potential employers.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), nearly white but just enough to communicate the separation between different sections.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), an analogous color with slightly increased saturation, to give important information (buttons, hyperlinks) additional emphasis and make them more accessible.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a clean modern look, and 'Playfair' (serif) for headers to give titles an eye-catching elegant look.
- Clean and simple icons to represent project categories and skills. Use icons sparingly to avoid visual clutter.
- Ensure the layout is intuitive and mobile-responsive. Maintain consistent spacing and alignment.
- Subtle hover animations on project cards and buttons to provide visual feedback and encourage interaction. Subtle scrolling animations.
